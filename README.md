There are 3 notebooks in this repository:

Analysis: The dataset is examined, feature relevance on target is found out. Few new features are added.

Encoding: Categorical features are encoded via various methods. The encoded features in dataset will be useful when using non-tree-based models

Tree-based models + Evaluation: Used RFE to select relevant features and applied Adaboost, Random Forest and Gradient Boost

The best test set accuracy achieved is 85.6%, while the dev set accuracy stands at 96%
